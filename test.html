<p>Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva is a divine light bestowed on the society prevelant in the 15th Century in Assam which was experiencing the pit of all evil and social unrest. The forces of the dark were at the pinnacle, almost threatening to demolish the very foundation of the society by adversely creeping in the minds of people who could be easily influenced in the name of religion, cast and creed to penetrate an agenda of rampant destruction, acrimonious conspiracy to unsettle everyone with fear, lust, and greed.</p> 
<p>The great Saint was born in the 15th century in Bordua, in  Nogaon district of Assam in a powerful kingdom of Bhuyans, in a royal family. He was even made the “Gomosta” a royal designate to rule. However, from the very sunrise of his life, Sankardeva was believed to have come with a different mission in his life. At a very tender age, after completing basic education, he went on a pilgrimage across many holy places in India and was moved by the religious and cultural diversity. He developed a strong connect towards the prayers and closeness to the Almighty. By returning from those Yatras, he first started writing Geet, Naat and Nritya. At that time, Nava Vasihnav Dharma ( Neo Vaishnavism) was getting prominence in other parts of the country. Sankardeva was also influenced by its ethos and hence he pioneered the principles of “Vaishnav Dharma” in the North-Eastern region of India, primarily in the state of Assam. He utilized his creations of Nritya, Geet, Bhaona and other literature to ingrain the Vaishnavite cult among the people. “Hari Naam” or “Kirttan” was preached as the only way to reach the “Coron” of the Almighty, Lord Vishnu. With the passage of time, his creations and thoughts started to appeal to other saintly people and apparently to the masses who flocked in many numbers to join him. It also took the form of a revolution in itself, where the practice of Sattriya culture had become the way of life. Thus, Mahapurush Sankardeva was able to unite the people from their diverse evil paths into the ways of Vaishnav cult.</p>
