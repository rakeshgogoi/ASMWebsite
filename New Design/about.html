                        <!-- <img src="images/DSCN5052.jpg" style="height: 600px;width:900px"> -->
                        <p class="animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInDown"> The Asom Sattra Mahasabha, is a registered socio-cultural organization that serves as the umbrella organization for the Sattra of Assam which aims at preserving and propagating the religious and socio-cultural teachings of Mahapurusha Srimanta Sankardeva.  Since its inception in 1915, as Santa Sanmilani,  Sattra Sangha in 1945 and Sattra Mahasabha in 1990, the organization has been ardently engaged in the development and spread of Sattriya Sanskriti (Culture). There are 862 Sattra in the state of Assam, and Koch Behar.  There are several Naamghar in Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland, practicing Sattriya Sanskriti for a very long time.</p>

<p class="animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInDown">In the words of Dr. Arshiya Sethi, “What makes the Asom Sattra Mahasabha a significant institution, is the fact that it emerged out of self reflection, to serve a specific self determined agenda. It is motivated by an idealist goal, seeks out governmental and non-governmental partners when necessary, and it works methodically through organizational practices”.</p>

<p class="animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInDown">The ASM has been able to draw attention to all the problems that the Sattra are facing, be it theft of valuable religious objects, illegal occupation of their lands and conversions to other faiths. The thefts are being described by the ASM as a national loss. In response to conversion of persons to other faith through the lure of money or otherwise, the ASM has taken up reconversion process as well.</p>

<p class="animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInDown">The Preservance and spread of spiritual way of life preached by Mahapurusha Sankardeva is being continued by ASM in the ‘Naamghar’ constructed in Jorhat that provides necessary infrastructure for the organization to conduct regular official activities. A well constructed auditorium also provides ample opportunity to further the cause of other communities.  It is worth mentioning that the plot of Land for construction measuring approximately one acre is donated by Assam Tea Company. </p>

<p class="animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInDown">Asom Sattra Mahasabha has encouraged the preservation of old manuscripts and books written by earlier Gurus.  Several books on Sattra are published by ASM for the use by the people of Assam as well as outside Assam.  One of the main treaties of Vaishnavism in Assam is ‘the Kirttana’.  This Holy Book has been translated into English by Late Chandrakanta Mahanta.  Asom Sattra Mahasabha published this book in 1990. The second edition has been published in December 2014 under the management of Asom Sattra Mahasabha, New Delhi Chapter. Under the organization, Prakashan Samiti, the publications division, takes care of bringing out books, publicity material and an annual magazine, the SattraManjari.</p>

<p class="animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInDown">With the aim of contributing to and preserving the peace and unity in the society, Asom Sattra Mahasabha organized “Shanti Yatra” (peace march) throughout Assam in the year 1999 -2000.Asom Sattra Mahasabha by its assiduous zeal, established one Music College at Rajabari,  Jorhat named “Asom Sattriya Sangeet Mahavidyalay” under Dibrugarh University of Assam.As a result of the efforts made by Asom Sattra Mahasabha and the few eminent personalities of Sattriya Culture, including Dr. Bhupen Hazarika, Sattriya Nrittya has been recognized as a classical form of dance in India by Sangeet Natak Academy on 15th November , 2000.</p>

<p class="animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInDown">The mark the date of recognition, Asom Sattra Mahasabha has been observing this day as “Sattriya Sanskriti Divas” every year, wherein different attributes of Sattriya Sanskriti are exhibited in Assam and New Delhi.</p>

<p class="animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInDown">To encourage the involvement of other communities into Sattriya Sanskriti, Asom Sattra Mahasabha is organizing “Setubandha Bhaona Samaroh”, where different communities of Assam participate in the performance of Ankia Bhaona.  This event was first held in 2003 at Guwahati with the association of Srimanta Foundation and since then, the event has been organized in regular intervals by the Asom Sattra Mahasabha.</p>
<p class="animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInDown">Asom Sattra Mahasabha established “Pariksha Parishad” and “Sattriya Sanskriti Charcha Kendra” with a view to preserving and propagating Sattriya Culture and heritage.  With a number of training centers under this institute, a well articulated syllabus for academic degrees is run through to standardize the various aspects of Sattriya Sanskriti.</p>

<p class="animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInDown">Asom Sattra Mahasabha has been instrumental in allocation and distribution of Central Government funds towards preservation of several Sattra in Assam. The proper interactive representation of ASM on behalf of the Sattra has resulted into the recognition of the difficulties faced by the Sattra and their requirements towards performance of duties to the society. The organization has taken up various steps towards reacquiring of land belongs to Sattra after taking legal and political actions against the encroachers and land illegally occupied by migrants. The Mahasabha has supplied documentary evidence to the government for nearly 2000 acres of land belonging to 39 Sattra of Assam which have been illegally occupied. The reduction in revenue from land has become a major financial hurdle in the progress of the Sattra.</p>

“Sattriya Sanskriti Charcha Kendra” was established by Asom Sattra Mahasabha in 1984. Initially the training of young students in different aspects of Sattriya Sanskriti started in the head office of the organization and subsequently several music schools were set up under its jurisdiction.

For a proper academic curriculum, a syllabus with five year duration is drawn up by Asom Sattra Mahasabha. After completion of the course in respective stream, the student is conferred an academic honour as “Visharad Degree” equivalent to (B.Mus) by Asom Sattra Mahasabha.</p>
